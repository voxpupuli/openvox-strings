          This type provides Puppet with the capabilities to manage GPG keys needed
          by apt to perform package validation. Apt has it's own GPG keyring that can
          be manipulated through the `apt-key` command.
          @example here's an example
            apt_key { '6F6B15509CF8E59E6E469F327F438280EF8D349F':
              source => 'http://apt.puppetlabs.com/pubkey.gpg'

          If Puppet is given the location of a key file which looks like an absolute
          path this type will autorequire that file.
